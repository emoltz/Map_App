Currently, I am using the Leaflet Library to render the map, and then using those pre-built objects to link to my back-end.
</p>
<p>
The back-end consists of objects that take input data from the user and use it to put pins on the map and calculate other useful data.
</p>
<p>
Scope has currently been my challenge -- I started with a much narrower idea of how things would work in the back end and then had to refactor the code into appropriate classes, which broke some things. So I am working on fixing those loose ends now.
I'm still refactoring everything to make sure everything is very organized and neat.</p>
